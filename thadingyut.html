<h1>How to celebrate Thadingyut Festival<br>

</h1>
<p>During Thadingyut, pagodas and homes through the country are decorated
with electric lights, colorful paper lanterns, candles and even small
ceramic saucers filled with oill in which wicis are lit. Major religious
sites such as Shwedagon Pagoda are packed with pilgrims who light
candles to pay homage to the Buddha and gain merit. Each light adds to
the incredible spectacle of thousands of small flames burning in the
night. Out on the streets, meanwhile, some people light fireworks or
launch small hot-air balloons, which silently ascend and drift across
the sky before burning out.</p>

	<p>This festival is unique to Dawei and held on the full moon day. The
residents would go around the town and ask for donations on the eve of
the Thadingyut. Then they float the alms bowls on the river. This yearâ€™s
festival will be held small-scale.</p>
